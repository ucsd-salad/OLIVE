"""Benchmark LLM-generated swimming-safety plans with Alloy.

Each trial records the initial plan and any verifier-guided repairs. The main
analysis compares initial (no-loop) and final (with-loop) success rates.

The optional pass@k analysis follows Chen et al. (2021), Sec. 2.1: k samples
are generated per problem and the problem counts as solved if any of them is
correct. Here one sample is one LLM generation and "correct" means Alloy
reports SAFE, so k is a sample budget -- the same number of LLM calls for both
systems, and k samples cost exactly k iterations. pass@1 is a single
generation, which is the old "pass@0" ablation under the metric's standard
name. The unaided LLM draws its k samples i.i.d., so the unbiased estimator
1 - C(n-c, k) / C(n, k) applies; inside the repair loop each sample is
conditioned on the previous counterexample, so Olive's pass@k is measured
directly as the fraction of n replications that reach SAFE within k samples.

# Olive's loop sample j is conditioned on the counterexample from sample j-1 and
# drawn at temperature 0, so that premise fails and Olive's pass@k is measured
# directly from n independent replications of a k-sample budget instead.
